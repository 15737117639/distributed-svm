Distributed SVM
===============

Distributed SVM approaches implemented with MapReduce.

Current implemented simple approaches include:
	1. The Cascade SVM
	2. Bagging-Like SVM

Both approaches refer to:
	O. Meyer et al., "Support Vector Machines of Large Data Sets: Simple Parallel Approaches." Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Knowledge Discovery, Springer, 87-95, 2013

Also, we have used the LIBSVM library for the core training procedures. Reference:
